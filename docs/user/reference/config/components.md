# Components

Components are the primary unit of packaging in azldev. Each component corresponds to one or more RPM packages and is defined under `[components.<name>]` in the TOML configuration.

A component definition tells azldev where to find the spec file, how to customize it with overlays, how to configure the build, and what additional source files to download.

## Component Config

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Spec source | `spec` | [SpecSource](#spec-source) | No | Where to find the spec file for this component. Inherited from distro defaults if not specified. |
| Release config | `release` | [ReleaseConfig](#release-configuration) | No | Controls how the Release tag is managed during rendering |
| Overlays | `overlays` | array of [Overlay](overlays.md) | No | Modifications to apply to the spec and/or source files |
| Overlay files | `overlay-files` | array of string | No | Path or glob patterns that load per-file overlay documents after component config resolution. Inherited relative patterns are resolved from the concrete component's config file, or from the matched spec file's directory for spec-discovered components. Use `[]` to disable inherited patterns. See [Per-file overlay format](overlays.md#per-file-overlay-format). |
| Build config | `build` | [BuildConfig](#build-configuration) | No | Build-time options (macros, conditionals, check config) |
| Render config | `render` | [RenderConfig](#render-configuration) | No | Options controlling spec rendering behavior |
| Source files | `source-files` | array of [SourceFileReference](#source-file-references) | No | Additional source files to download for this component |
| Package overrides | `packages` | map of string → [PackageConfig](package-groups.md#package-config) | No | Exact per-package configuration overrides; highest priority in the resolution order |
| Tests | `tests` | [ComponentTests](#component-tests) | No | Test references that apply to this component (see [Tests and Test Groups](tests.md)) |

### Bare Components

The simplest component definition is a bare entry with no fields. This inherits all configuration from the distro defaults:

```toml
[components.curl]
```

With a default distro config pointing to Fedora 43, this is equivalent to explicitly writing:

```toml
[components.curl]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-distro = { name = "fedora", version = "43" } }
```

Bare entries are the most common component definition — the majority of components in a typical project need no per-component customization.

### File Organization

- **Inline** definitions in a shared file (e.g., `components.toml`) are preferred for bare components with no customization.
- **Dedicated** files (e.g., `bash/bash.comp.toml`) are preferred when a component has overlays, build config, or other customization.

The `includes = ["**/*.comp.toml"]` pattern in `components.toml` automatically picks up all dedicated component files.

> **Note:** Each component name must be unique across all config files. Defining the same component in two files produces an error.

## Spec Source

The `spec` field identifies where azldev should find the RPM spec file for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Source type | `type` | string | **Yes** | Spec source type: `"upstream"`, `"local"`, or `""` (empty) |
| Path | `path` | string | No | Path to the spec file (for `local` type). Relative to the config file. |
| Upstream distro | `upstream-distro` | [DistroReference](distros.md#distro-references) | No | Which distro to pull the spec from (for `upstream` type) |
| Upstream name | `upstream-name` | string | No | Package name in the upstream distro, if different from the component name |
| Upstream commit | `upstream-commit` | string | No | Git commit hash (7–40 hex chars) to pin the upstream spec to. Takes priority over the distro snapshot. |

### Upstream Specs (Default)

Most components use upstream specs pulled from a distro's dist-git repository. If no `spec` is defined, the component inherits the upstream distro from the `default-component-config` in the distro version config:

```toml
# Uses the default upstream distro (inherited from distro config)
[components.curl]

# Explicitly specifies the upstream distro and version
[components.bash]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-distro = { name = "fedora", version = "rawhide" } }
```

When the upstream package has a different name than the component, use `upstream-name`:

```toml
[components.azurelinux-rpm-config]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-name = "redhat-rpm-config" }
```

### Commit-Pinned Specs

When you need to pin to a specific git commit — for example, to pick up a fix that hasn't been included in a tagged release yet — use `upstream-commit`:

```toml
[components.bash]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6789" }
```

The value must be a hex string between 7 and 40 characters (a short or full git commit hash). When `upstream-commit` is set, it takes priority over the distro snapshot date — azldev checks out the exact commit instead of finding the latest commit before a snapshot timestamp.

> **Note:** Commit-pinning is intended for temporary use. Once the desired change lands in a tagged upstream release, switch back to version-based pinning or the default snapshot to keep the component aligned with the upstream distro.

### Local Specs

For components that originate from your project (not imported from upstream), use a local spec:

```toml
[components.azurelinux-release]
spec = { type = "local", path = "azurelinux-release.spec" }
```

The `path` is relative to the config file that defines the component. Local spec files and any associated source files should be placed alongside the component's `.comp.toml` file.

## Release Configuration

The `[components.<name>.release]` section controls how azldev manages the Release tag during rendering.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Calculation | `calculation` | string | No | One of `"auto"` (default), `"autorelease"`, `"static"`, or `"manual"` |

### Calculation Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | Auto-detects `%autorelease` and leaves it to rpmautospec. All other Release forms are bumped by `rpmdev-bumpspec`, once for each fingerprint-derived synthetic change. |
| `autorelease` | Explicitly declares the spec uses `%autorelease`. Skips all Release manipulation. Use this for specs with conditional `%autorelease`/`%else` fallbacks that confuse auto-detection. |
| `static` | Requires a non-`%autorelease` Release and invokes `rpmdev-bumpspec` once for each fingerprint-derived synthetic change. rpmdev-bumpspec natively attempts integer, dotted, macro, conditional, and fallback forms; azldev accepts the operation only when host RPM evaluation proves the source Release is strictly newer. Inactive conditional definitions or otherwise ineffective mutations fail and restore the original spec. |
| `manual` | Skips all automatic Release manipulation. Use for components that manage their own release numbering (e.g. kernel). |

Most components use `auto` (the default) and need no release configuration. Examples:

```toml
# Spec with conditional %autorelease that auto-detection gets wrong:
[components.gvisor-tap-vsock.release]
calculation = "autorelease"

# Component that manages its own release numbering:
[components.kernel.release]
calculation = "manual"
```

### Host requirement and troubleshooting

Automatic non-`%autorelease` release handling requires `rpmdev-bumpspec`,
`rpmdev-packager`, `rpm`, `rpmspec`, and `python3` with the RPM Python module. The
tested implementation is `rpmdevtools` 9.6 (`rpmdev-bumpspec` 1.0.13), but azldev
accepts a behaviorally compatible newer implementation: it evaluates exactly the
source package EVR with `rpmspec --srpm` before and after every bump and verifies that
RPM orders the new Release strictly higher. azldev converts `build.with` and
`build.without` to their effective `_with_<name>` and `_without_<name>` macro
definitions, then applies explicit defines and undefines with the same precedence as
the build. A component build also passes `target_arch` from `--mock-config-opt` to
both evaluations and the wrapped RPM command; render and `prepare-sources` use the
host RPM target when no target is otherwise available. azldev uses normal host vendor
macros, an isolated HOME, and fixed locale/timezone. If render, build, or
`prepare-sources` (which creates dist-git by default; `--without-git` opts out)
reports a missing or incompatible tool, provision the host runtime rather than adding
a Release overlay.

This is a transitional mutation engine: locks and synthetic history still determine
the ordered fingerprint changes, and azldev invokes `rpmdev-bumpspec` once per
change. Each invocation uses the fixed Azure Linux Packaging Team identity, `- rebuilt`
comment, and `Mon Jan 06 2025` datestamp, so fingerprint author/message/time data do
not affect generated release or changelog bytes. The tool may update both `Release:`
(or its preferred release macro) and `%changelog`; `%autorelease` remains unchanged.
This does not introduce lock-free release calculation or redesign final changelog
ordering.

## Render Configuration

The `[components.<name>.render]` section controls rendering behavior for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Skip file filter | `skip-file-filter` | boolean | No | Disable post-render file filtering (defaults to `false`) |

### Skip File Filter

During rendering, azldev uses `spectool` to determine which files are referenced by `Source` and `Patch` tags in the spec, then removes unreferenced files from the rendered output. Some specs use dynamic macros (e.g., `%{fontpkgname1}`) that `spectool` cannot expand, causing it to report incorrect filenames. This results in referenced files being incorrectly removed.

Set `skip-file-filter = true` to preserve all files from the dist-git checkout:

```toml
[components.dejavu-fonts.render]
skip-file-filter = true
```

> **Note:** This should only be used for specs with macros that `spectool` cannot resolve. For most components, the default filtering behavior is correct and keeps the rendered output clean.

## Build Configuration

The `[components.<name>.build]` section controls build-time options for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| With options | `with` | string array | No | Build conditionals to enable (`--with <option>` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Without options | `without` | string array | No | Build conditionals to disable (`--without <option>` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Macro definitions | `defines` | map of string to string | No | RPM macro definitions (`--define '<name> <value>'` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Undefined macros | `undefines` | string array | No | RPM macro names to undefine (`--undefine '<name>'` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Emit upstream provenance | `emit-upstream-provenance` | boolean | No | Inject `%fedora_upstream_version`/`%fedora_upstream_release` macros for Fedora upstream components (defaults to `false`) |
| Check config | `check` | [CheckConfig](#check-configuration) | No | Configuration for the `%check` section of the spec |
| Failure config | `failure` | [FailureConfig](#failure-configuration) | No | Configuration and policy regarding build failures |
| Build hints | `hints` | [BuildHints](#build-hints) | No | Non-essential hints for how or when to build the component |

### With / Without Options

These correspond to rpmbuild's `--with` and `--without` flags, which toggle `%bcond` conditionals in spec files:

```toml
# Enable the "as_wget" build conditional
[components.wget2.build]
with = ["as_wget"]

# Disable the "debug" kernel variant to reduce build time
[components.kernel.build]
without = ["debug"]

# Disable the RedHat subscription manager plugin
[components.dnf5.build]
without = ["plugin_rhsm"]
```

### Macro Definitions

The `defines` field sets RPM macros that are available during the build. Each key-value pair becomes a `--define 'key value'` argument to rpmbuild:

```toml
[components.mypackage.build]
defines = { rhel = "11" }
```

The `undefines` field removes macros that would otherwise be defined:

```toml
[components.mypackage.build]
undefines = ["fedora"]
```

### Upstream Provenance Macros

For components sourced from a Fedora upstream (`spec.type = "upstream"` with a Fedora `upstream-distro`), azldev can inject two macros into the component's build so the spec can record where it was derived from (useful for SBAT and similar provenance metadata). This is **opt-in** — enable it with `emit-upstream-provenance`:

```toml
[components.grub2.build]
emit-upstream-provenance = true
```

| Macro | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `%fedora_upstream_version` | The `Version` tag from the pristine upstream Fedora spec |
| `%fedora_upstream_release` | The `Release` tag from the pristine upstream Fedora spec, with `%{?dist}` expanded to the Fedora dist tag (e.g. `.fc43`) |

The values are read from the upstream spec **before** any azldev overlays are applied, so they reflect the true upstream Name-Version-Release, not the Azure Linux–modified spec. The macros are derived fresh at render/build time from the pinned upstream commit and emitted into the component's generated macros file (loaded via `%{load:...}`).

For specs whose `Release` uses rpmautospec (`Release: %autorelease`), the pristine Fedora release number is computed by running `rpmautospec calculate-release` in the project distro's mock chroot against the upstream dist-git checkout (whose history is Fedora's, not azldev's synthetic overlay history). This keeps `rpmautospec` out of azldev's host dependencies. If the project distro has no mock config, or mock resolution fails, `%fedora_upstream_release` is skipped (with a warning) rather than emitting the literal `%autorelease`.

Example: for a component pinned to Fedora 43's `grub2-2.12-5.fc43`, the spec can reference:

```spec
%sbat_generate_metadata ... derived from grub2 %{?fedora_upstream_version}-%{?fedora_upstream_release}
```

which expands to `grub2 2.12-5.fc43`. The conditional macro form (`%{?name}`) is recommended because provenance emission is best-effort: `%fedora_upstream_release` is skipped when the upstream spec can't be parsed or when mock cannot resolve `%autorelease`, and the conditional form degrades gracefully (expanding to empty) instead of referencing an undefined macro.

Notes:

- The flag has no effect on local or SRPM components (they have no upstream provenance) or on non-Fedora upstreams; for those it is silently ignored.
- If a component defines a macro of the same name via `build.defines`, the user-defined value wins — the injected value does not overwrite it.
- **How tag values are resolved:** `Version` and `Release` are read as plain text from the pristine upstream spec. `%{?dist}` is substituted with the Fedora dist tag, and `%autorelease` is resolved to a concrete number via `rpmautospec` (see above). Any *other* in-spec macros — e.g. `Version: %{majorver}.%{minorver}` — are emitted into the macros file unexpanded. Because that file is loaded back into the same spec via `%{load:...}`, RPM expands them lazily at build time using the spec's own macro definitions, so the consuming spec still sees the correct fully-expanded value.

Limitations:

- When `Version`/`Release` is built from other in-spec macros, those macros are resolved lazily at build time against the **overlaid** spec, not the pristine upstream one. So if an overlay redefines a macro that the upstream `Version`/`Release` depends on (e.g. `%majorver`), the provenance value reflects the overlaid definition. This is rare in practice — overlays rarely change version macros.
- Listing `fedora_upstream_version` or `fedora_upstream_release` in `build.undefines` does **not** suppress the injected macros — they are layered on after `undefines` is applied. To disable them, set `emit-upstream-provenance = false` (or omit it) instead.

### Check Configuration

The `check` field controls the `%check` section of the spec (the package's test suite).

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Skip | `skip` | boolean | No | When `true`, disables the `%check` section by prepending `exit 0` (defaults to `false`) |
| Skip reason | `skip_reason` | string | Conditional | Justification for why tests are being skipped. **Required when `skip` is `true`.** |

```toml
[components.containerd.build]
check = { skip = true, skip_reason = "Tests require network access unavailable in build environment" }
```

> **Note:** The `skip_reason` field is mandatory when `skip` is `true`. This ensures that disabling tests is always documented and traceable. azldev will report a validation error if `skip_reason` is missing.

### Failure Configuration

The `failure` field configures how azldev handles build failures for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Expected | `expected` | boolean | No | When `true`, indicates that this component is expected to fail building (defaults to `false`) |
| Expected reason | `expected-reason` | string | Conditional | Justification for why the component is expected to fail. **Required when `expected` is `true`.** |

This is intended as a temporary marker for components that are known to fail until they can be fixed — for example, when importing a batch of packages where some have unresolved dependency issues:

```toml
[components.broken-package.build]
failure = { expected = true, expected-reason = "Missing build dependency not yet available in Azure Linux" }
```

> **Note:** The `expected-reason` field is mandatory when `expected` is `true`. This ensures that expected failures are always documented and traceable.

### Build Hints

The `hints` field provides non-essential metadata about how or when to build a component. These hints do not affect build correctness but may be used by tools and CI systems for scheduling and resource allocation.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Expensive | `expensive` | boolean | No | When `true`, indicates that building this component is resource-intensive and should be carefully considered when scheduling (defaults to `false`) |

```toml
[components.kernel.build]
hints = { expensive = true }
```

## Package Configuration

Components can customize the configuration for the binary packages they produce using the `packages` map.

### Per-Package Overrides

The `[components.<name>.packages.<pkgname>]` map lets you override config for a **specific** binary package by its exact name. This is the highest-priority layer and overrides all inherited defaults:

```toml
# Override just one subpackage
[components.curl.packages.curl-devel.publish]
rpm-channel = "rpm-devel"
```

### Resolution Order

For each binary package produced by a component, the effective config is assembled in this order (later layers win):

1. Project `default-package-config`
2. Package group containing this package name (if any)
3. Component `packages.<exact-name>` (highest priority)

The component's `[publish]` section provides default channels for all packages that don't have explicit overrides. See [Publish Settings](#publish-settings) for details.

See [Package Groups](package-groups.md) for the full field reference and a complete example.

### Publish Settings

The `[components.<name>.publish]` section sets default publish channels for all packages produced by this component. These channels are inherited by every binary package unless overridden by a package-group or per-package setting.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| RPM Channel | `rpm-channel` | string | No | Default publish channel for binary (non-debuginfo) packages |
| SRPM Channel | `srpm-channel` | string | No | Publish channel for the SRPM |
| Debuginfo Channel | `debuginfo-channel` | string | No | Publish channel for debuginfo and debugsource packages |

### Example

```toml
[components.curl]

# Set component-level default channels via publish
[components.curl.publish]
rpm-channel = "rpm-base"
srpm-channel = "rpm-base-srpm"
debuginfo-channel = "rpm-base-debuginfo"

# ... but put curl-devel in the "devel" channel
[components.curl.packages.libcurl-devel.publish]
rpm-channel = "rpm-devel"

# Signal to downstream tooling that this package should not be published
[components.curl.packages.libcurl-minimal.publish]
rpm-channel = "none"
```

## Component Tests

The `[components.<name>.tests]` subtable lists test or test-group
references that apply to the component. Each entry is a [TestRef](tests.md#test-reference)
with exactly one of `name` or `group`.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Tests | `tests` | array of [TestRef](tests.md#test-reference) | No | References to `[tests.<name>]` entries or `[test-groups.<name>]` entries |

```toml
[components.kernel.tests]
tests = [
  { group = "kernel-bvt" },
  { name  = "kdump-smoke" },
]
```

## Source File References

The `[[components.<name>.source-files]]` array defines additional source files to fetch or generate before building — binaries, pre-built artifacts, or archives generated on-the-fly by a script.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Filename | `filename` | string | **Yes** | Name of the file in the sources directory |
| Hash | `hash` | string | Conditional | Expected hash. Required unless `--allow-no-hashes` is passed to `prep-sources` (which computes and prints the hash). |
| Hash type | `hash-type` | string | Conditional | Hash algorithm (`"SHA256"`, `"SHA512"`). Required with `hash`; defaults to `"SHA512"` when auto-computed. |
| Origin | `origin` | [Origin](#origin) | **Yes** | How to obtain the file |
| Replace upstream | `replace-upstream` | bool | No | Replace the same-named entry in the upstream `sources` file. The upstream entry must exist. Requires `replace-reason`. |
| Replace reason | `replace-reason` | string | Conditional | Required when `replace-upstream = true`. Logged by `prep-sources` for auditability. |

### Origin

Three origin types are supported.

#### `"download"` — fetch from a URI

`origin = { type = "download", uri = "https://..." }`. The `uri` field is required.

```toml
[[components.shim.source-files]]
filename  = "shimx64.efi"
hash      = "7741013d9a24ce554bf6a9df6b776a57b114055e..."
hash-type = "SHA512"
origin    = { type = "download", uri = "https://example.com/repo/.../shimx64.efi" }
```

#### `"custom"` — generate via a mock script

Use `origin.type = "custom"` when a source archive must be assembled or modified (e.g. stripping sensitive test fixtures from an upstream tarball). azldev runs the script inside a fresh mock chroot — the script **must write all output to `/azldev-gen/output/`**, which azldev packages into the archive named by `filename`. Network access is always enabled; the mock config comes from the project's default distro.

Custom sources are regenerated on every source preparation rather than restored from lookaside. The generated archive is validated against its configured hash, so changes to the script or its inputs fail with a hash mismatch until the hash is intentionally refreshed.

For an upstream component, each script filename is resolved relative to the TOML file that declares that `source-files` entry. This remains true when the component is assembled from multiple included configuration files. For a local component, the script remains a sidecar beside the component's spec file.

The `script`, `mock-packages`, and `inputs` fields are nested under `[origin]`:

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Script | `origin.script` | string | **Yes** | Script filename to run in mock. Relative to the declaring TOML file for upstream components, or the spec directory for local components. Required for `origin.type = "custom"`. |
| Mock packages | `origin.mock-packages` | array of string | No | Extra RPM packages to install in the mock chroot before the script runs. |
| Inputs | `origin.inputs` | array of string | No | Unique filenames to make available in the mock chroot before the script runs. Each file must already be present in the fetched source output directory — upstream source tarballs, sidecar files (patches, scripts), and any earlier `source-files` entries are all placed there by the upstream fetch before custom scripts run. |

On first use, omit `hash` and run `prep-sources --allow-no-hashes` to generate the archive and print its hash, then copy it into the TOML.

```toml
[[components.yara.source-files]]
filename  = "yara-4.5.4-azl-stripped.tar.gz"
hash-type = "SHA512"
hash      = "abc123..."               # from: prep-sources --allow-no-hashes
origin.type          = "custom"
origin.script        = "gen-yara-stripped.sh"    # beside this TOML file for an upstream component
origin.mock-packages = ["cmake"]                 # omit if not needed
origin.inputs        = ["yara-4.5.4.tar.gz"]     # available to the script as ./yara-4.5.4.tar.gz
```

**Note:** Upstream source tarballs are automatically available as inputs before running custom generation scripts. There is no need to re-declare an upstream file in `source-files` to use it as an input.

#### `"overlay"` — record a post-overlay hash

- **`hash` and `hash-type` are required** for normal use. To bootstrap a new archive overlay, omit both and run `prep-sources --allow-no-hashes` once; it computes the post-overlay hash for you.
- **`replace-upstream = true` is required** — the archive already exists in the upstream `sources` file, and this entry replaces its hash with the post-overlay value.
- During `prep-sources` (full run), azldev verifies that the hash it computed after repacking the archive matches the stated `hash`. A mismatch means the config is stale and must be updated.
- The post-overlay archive is hashed using the configured `hash-type`, regardless of the algorithm used by the upstream `sources` entry. The archive's actual compression format is preserved when repacking, even when it does not match the filename extension.

See [Recording the post-overlay hash for archive overlays](#recording-the-post-overlay-hash-for-archive-overlays) below for the full workflow.

### Recording the post-overlay hash for archive overlays

When you apply archive overlays (e.g. removing vendored files from a tarball) using `file-remove` or `file-search-replace` with an archive-scoped path, the repacked archive has a different hash than the original. Use a `source-files` entry with `origin.type = "overlay"` to record the expected post-overlay hash:

```toml
[[components.apache-commons-compress.source-files]]
filename = "commons-compress-1.27.1-src.tar.gz"
hash = "c7a2cef26959e687ad19b96b5ba8393d7514095e13bf0f29bd41e6b3c3cb2260d8ff23283ff3d5fd137b2522b843e7f0f50ab46bcf0f66df5383674f35f223ab"
hash-type = "SHA512"
origin = { type = "overlay" }
replace-upstream = true
replace-reason = "Upstream source tarball contains test fixtures flagged as malware by the AZL RPM signing pipeline. These files are not needed at runtime and are removed to allow SRPM publication."
```

**Workflow:**

1. Add the archive overlay(s) in the component's `[[overlays]]` array.
2. Run `prep-sources --allow-no-hashes` once — this repacks the archive and writes the computed hash to the output `sources` file.
3. Paste the computed `hash` and `hash-type` into the `source-files` entry above.
4. Run `prep-sources` again to confirm the hash matches, then commit.

`replace-upstream = true` and `replace-reason` are required because the archive is already in the upstream `sources` file. The entry replaces its hash with the post-overlay value, regardless of how many overlays target that archive.

### Replacing an upstream `sources` entry

A `source-files` entry whose `filename` collides with an upstream `sources` entry is an error by default. Set `replace-upstream = true` (with a non-empty `replace-reason`) to intentionally substitute it:

```toml
[[components.example.source-files]]
filename         = "example-1.0.tar.gz"
hash             = "deadbeef..."
hash-type        = "SHA512"
origin           = { type = "download", uri = "https://internal.example.com/example-1.0-patched.tar.gz" }
replace-upstream = true
replace-reason   = "patched to fix CVE-2026-0001 before upstream"
```

`prep-sources` removes the matching upstream entry, inserts the new one in its place, and logs a `WARN` with both hashes and the reason. If no upstream entry with that filename exists, `prep-sources` fails — this is almost always a stale config or filename typo. Drop `replace-upstream` if you intended a brand-new
  artifact instead.

`replace-upstream` and `replace-reason` are per-entry switches, not a
per-component setting; multiple entries within the same `source-files` array
can opt in independently.
